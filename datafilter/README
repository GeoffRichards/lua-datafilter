This Lua library makes it convenient to process data using various
algorithms, and to handle arbitrarily large amounts of input and output data
with them.

Currently the algorithms supported are: MD5 and SHA-1 message digests,
Adler32 checksumming, Base64 encoding and decoding, quoted-printable
encoding and decoding, encoding binary data as hexadecimal, and percent/URI
encoding and decoding.

When you unpack the source code everything should already be ready for
compilation.  Doing "make install" as root will compile everything, and
install the compiled library and some man pages describing it.

See lua-datafilter(3) for an overview of how to use the library.  The same
documentation is available on the website, where you can also get the
latest packages:
